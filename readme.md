#Retargeting Documentation

| Function | Required | Description | Status |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|setEmail |Required | This function needs to be called each time a guest register, logs in or completes the email address in a form from the website (e.g. Contact or Newsletter Form).| - |
|sendCategory |Required | This function must be called when a visitor goes to a category page. In this case, the category page is the page that displays the category details and the list of subcategories belonging to the first or the page that lists the products of a certain category. | - |
|sendBrand |Optional |This function must be called every time a visitor goes to the producer/brand page. In this case, the brand page is the page where the brand details are listed, or the page that lists the products belonging to that brand. | - |
|sendProduct | Required |This function must be called every time a visitor clicks on a product details page. | - |
|addToCart | Required |This function must be called every time a product is added to cart. If you redirect to another page (e.g. the checkout page) right after the user added the product to cart, the add to cart must be set in the function of the callback function, right after the data has been sent to Retargeting (see the examples of the addToCart function). If add to cart is possible in other pages too, other than in the product details page, you must first call the sendProduct function (for the product that will be added to cart) right before you call the addToCart function (see the examples of the addToCart function). In the following paragraphs of the addToCart function, we will talk about "variations" of the products. Variation of a product is the product properties group the user has to choose when he is willing to add a product to cart: color, size, capacity, etc. For example, an online fashion store can set a system based on color and size variations: "Y-32" (yellow color and size 32), "R-XS" (red color and size XS), "M" (size M) etc. | - |
|setVariations | Optional |This function must be called every time when a product variation is selected. It can be seen that the parameters are the same as those of addToCart function. If add to cart event it is possible in other pages than the product details page (implicitly the selection of variation), so the sendProduct function is not called first, then before calling setVariation, call sendProduct function for the product following to be added to cart (see the examples of the setVariation function). In the following paragraphs of the setVariation function, we will talk about "variations" of the products. Variation of a product is the product properties group the user has to choose when he is willing to add a product to cart: color, size, capacity, etc. For example, an online fashion store can set a system based on color and size variations: "Y-32" (yellow color and size 32), "R-XS" (red color and size XS), "M" (size M) etc. | - |
|addToWishlist | Optional |This function must be called every time a product is added to a wishlist. If add to wishlist can be done in other page than in the product details page (the sendProduct function is not being called), proceed the same as in addToCart function (see the examples from addToCart function). | - |

|saveOrder | Required |This function must be called whenever an order is successfully registered. For any payment method, the function saveOrder must be called always on the Thank You page (the page where the user is informed the order was registered). If there is no Thank You page, saveOrder function must be called after the order is successfully stored in the database. For example, for online payment method, saveOrder function must be called after the response from the payment processor is received and the answer is positive (not error or fail). In this case it means the order is successfully registered (was paid). saveOrder function must be called on the Thank You page, when all the registration process of the order is over. | - |
